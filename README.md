# Tsoding Emacs Theme Serene Edition <br>
I stumbled upon Tsoding's Emacs theme, liked it, and thought, "Is there any similar themes for VSCode?". <br> Found a couple of similar themes, but none quite hit the spot for me. So, I made my own twist. <br> **Tsoding Emacs Serene Edition for VSCode**. It's a bit of Tsoding's vibe with my flavor. Not re-inventing the wheel, just making my coding space a tad more comfy.
